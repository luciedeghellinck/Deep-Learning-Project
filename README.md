## Installing packages
I initiated this repository using pipenv, I will be adding packages using pipenv and I suggest you do the same. Initiating this repository can be done using one of the following commands:

`pipenv install` or
`python -m pipenv install`

If neither of these work I would first install pipenv using either

`pip install pipenv` or
`python -m pip install pipenv`

Make sure you have python 3.8 installed! This is the same runtime google colab is using, so if you do not use this this will lead to problems later.

You can add new packages (if neccessary), using

`pipenv install pandas` or
`python -m pipenv install pandas`
